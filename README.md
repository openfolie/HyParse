# HyParse

Hypixel is a popular Minecraft server that offers various game modes like SkyBlock, BedWars, and more.  
It provides an official API â€” the **Hypixel Public API** â€” which returns massive and complex JSON responses, often ranging from 100 to over 120,000 lines!

**HyParse** is a Python module (available via pip) that simplifies and structures this data.  
Instead of digging through messy JSON, HyParse extracts and reformats the data into concise, easy-to-access Python objects.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
pip install hyparse
```

## Features

- Parses and processes Hypixel API's player JSON data.
- Converts raw JSON blobs into structured, easily accessible data.
- Example usage: `Player().dungeons_data` to get dungeon-related stats quickly.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Dependencies**: *(To be listed later)*
- **API Used**: Hypixel Public API

## Usage

Documentation coming soon. The core idea is to:

- Fetch player data using the Hypixel API.
- Access structured data using simple Python objects like `Player()`.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**  
Full documentation and examples will be added soon.
